# Plan & Find
_from spring 2018_

The website is **under development**.
Fir appeared in . Also plan to improve my design.
[See it here](https://andrewkreshchenko.github.io/LoadingStreetview/)

Used APIs:
1. Google APIs
    - Geocoding API
    - Maps JavaScript API
    - Street View Static API
2. Wikipedia API (to load articles)
3. NewYork Times API (to load articles)

:thought_balloon: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) is aimed to be used for server-side. I'm gonna use Pug to render components to static markup.
